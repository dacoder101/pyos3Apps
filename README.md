# pyos3 Apps
Smaller scale apps that may be integrated into pyos3 through the app store.

Apps are organized by folders based off their organization in pyos3.
It also might include projects built-in to pyos3, not through the app store.

It is planned to have the app store download from this repository.
<hr>

Some apps format very different from others, and may not be as much of quality.

These apps will provide NO releases, and are designed for UNIX (Linux/MacOS), although some may work for Windows operating systems.

<b>With that, it is highly recommended to use WSL if your on Windows when using any of these smaller projects. Note that some may not work at all as they are specifically designed for pyos3.</b>

<i>You can install WSL with <code>wsl --install</code> using CMD followed by a restart. You will then be prompted to type a password. You may want to install git to clone this repository to your WSL enviornment.</i>
